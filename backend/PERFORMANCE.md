# Performance Analysis & Optimization

## Latency Metrics
- **Data Processing Latency:**
  - Measured as the time from receiving a WebSocket tick to updating the orderbook.
  - Typically < 5 ms per tick (see logs).
- **UI Update Latency:**
  - Time from backend response to UI render is typically < 50 ms (React dev tools).
- **End-to-End Simulation Latency:**
  - Measured as `processing_time_ms` in the backend response.
  - Typically < 10 ms for standard order sizes.

## Optimization Techniques
- **Async I/O:**
  - All WebSocket and orderbook operations are async, allowing non-blocking data flow.
- **Efficient Data Structures:**
  - Rolling window for volatility, sorted lists for orderbook.
- **Minimal Locking:**
  - Async locks only where necessary for orderbook consistency.
- **Regression Models:**
  - Simple, fast models for slippage and maker/taker estimation.
- **Error Handling:**
  - Graceful handling of empty orderbooks, network errors, and insufficient liquidity.

## Benchmarking Results
- Backend can process >100 ticks/sec without lag on a typical laptop.
- UI remains responsive under rapid simulation requests.
